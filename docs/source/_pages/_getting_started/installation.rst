Installation
------------

Before studying systems with SwarmRL, it is important to have installed the package.
In this section, we will go over how to install SwarmRL in its most basic form.


From source
===========
Currently, SwarmRL is only available as a repository.
In the future, it may be moved to PyPi, but for now, it will need to be cloned from
GitHub and installed manually.

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/christophlohrmann/SwarmRL.git
   cd SwarmRL
   pip install .


After running these commands, SwarmRl will be available as a Python package and can be
used in any Python script with:

.. code-block:: python

   import swarmrl
