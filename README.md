# SwarmRL
SwarmRL is a Python package aimed at providing a simple and flexible framework for
developing and testing reinforcement learning and mathematical optimization algorithms
for multi-agent systems.
Some key features of SwarmRL include:

* Integration with EspressoMD simulation engine
* Support for experimental setups
* Actor critic reinforcement learning strategies

## Installation

Currently SwamrRL is only available from source so it must be installed within the local
directory.

```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SwarmRL/SwarmRL.git
   cd SwarmRL
   pip install .
```

## Getting Started

We are working on up-to-date documentation and examples and they will be made available
in the coming weeks.
